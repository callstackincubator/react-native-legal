import { PackageManagerTabs, Badge } from '@theme';

# Standalone CLI

## Installation

To get started, install the package using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install license-kit" />

## Programmatic usage (API)

Once the setup is complete, you can easily add a button to your app to display the list of open-source licenses:

```tsx

```

This will open a native screen listing all detected licenses. The title of the screen can be customized by passing a different string argument to `launchLicenseListScreen()`.
