# Programmatic Usage (API)

In case your use case involves programmatic usage of the functionality provided by `license-kit`, you can use the `@callstack/react-native-legal-shared` package. This package exposes the core functionalities of the license management tool, allowing you to integrate it into your Node.js applications.

## Installation

To get started, install the package using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @callstack/react-native-legal-shared" />

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import {
  generateAboutLibrariesNPMOutput,
  generateLicensePlistNPMOutput,
  scanDependencies,
  Types,
} from '@callstack/react-native-legal-shared';
import * as md from 'ts-markdown-builder';

// apart from dependencies, also include devDependencies, but only from the root package.json;
// also, include all transitive dependencies
const optionsFactory: Types.ScanPackageOptionsFactory = ({ isRoot }) => ({
  includeDevDependencies: isRoot,
  includeTransitiveDependencies: true,
});

// scan dependencies of a package
const licenses = scanDependencies(packageJsonPath, optionsFactory);

// generate AboutLibraries-compatible JSON metadata
const aboutLibrariesCompatibleReport = generateAboutLibrariesNPMOutput(licenses);

// generate LicensePlist-compatible metadata
const licensePlistReport = generateLicensePlistNPMOutput(licenses);

// generate a Markdown report
const markdownString = md
  .joinBlocks(
    Object.entries(licenses)
      .flatMap(([packageName, { version, author, content, description, file, type, url }]) => [
        md.heading(packageName, { level: 2 }),
        '\n',
        `Version: ${version}<br/>\n`,
        url ? `URL: ${url}<br/>\n` : '',
        author ? `Author: ${author}<br/>\n\n` : '',
        content ?? '',
        '\n',
        description ? `Description: ${description}\n` : '',
        file ? `\nFile: ${file}\n` : '',
        type ? `Type: ${type}` : '',
        '\n',
        md.horizontalRule,
      ])
      .join('\n'),
  )
  .toString();
```

### Options

As you can see in the example above, filtering for the packages to be included in the scan for dependencies is based on the passed in `ScanPackageOptionsFactory`. This factory would be invoked for every scanned `package.json` file, including the root and any considered dependencies and - given a `ScanPackageOptionsFactoryPackageInfo` object informing of the context of the package being scanned - should produce an accompanying configuration that would filter this package's dependencies.

This approach gives a programmatic control at an arbitrary level of precision over filtering of dependencies to be included.

As a reference, you can see how this is used in the `license-kit` CLI in [`createScanOptionsFactory` of `scanOptionsUtils.ts`](https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-legal/blob/main/packages/license-kit/src/scanOptionsUtils.ts).

### API Documentation

The API documentation is published under: https://callstackincubator.github.io/react-native-legal/api/.

## Additional details

### License Types

The tool recognizes various license types:

- **Strong Copyleft**: Licenses that require derivative works to be released under the same license (e.g., GPL-3.0)
- **Weak Copyleft**: Licenses that require derivative works to be released under the same license, but with some exceptions (e.g., LGPL-3.0)
- **Permissive**: Licenses that allow for more flexible use (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0)

### Monorepo Support

`react-native-legal` scans dependencies from workspace packages with the `workspace:*` notation in your `package.json` in addition to the app's direct dependencies.

:::info
If a monorepo package is private, its name and license won't be included in the license list, but its dependencies will still be scanned and included.
