React Native Legal (`react-native-legal`) helps you acknowledge open-source libraries in your React Native app by automatically generating and displaying license information using native platform tools. This ensures compliance with open-source licenses while maintaining a native user experience.

We expose the core functionality related to Node.JS dependencies as a standalone CLI tool, `license-kit`, which can be used in any Node.js project, not just React Native apps. This allows you to generate license reports for any Node.js application.

In case your use case involves programmatic usage of the functionality provided by `license-kit`, you can use the `@callstack/licenses` package. This package exposes the core functionalities of the license management tool, allowing you to integrate it into your Node.js applications.
