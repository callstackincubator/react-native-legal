## License Types

The tool recognizes various license types:

- **Strong Copyleft**: Licenses that require derivative works to be released under the same license (e.g., GPL-3.0)
- **Weak Copyleft**: Licenses that require derivative works to be released under the same license, but with some exceptions (e.g., LGPL-3.0)
- **Permissive**: Licenses that allow for more flexible use (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0)
